Magic exists in the form as a blessing gifted to those who bring special offerings to the gods and leave them at shrines.

## Enchanting
Enchanting is one of two ways of crafting. Enchanting is a way to infuse a physical object with magical properties. There are many different types of enchantments.

### Food
Magic can be used as part of the cooking process to imbue ingredients with new properties or enhance existing properties. In essence, it behaves like any other ingredient or cooking process.

### Weapons
Weapon enchantments will create special effects while araci is in combat, or when the weapon strikes an enemy.

### Blessings
Araci can ask for a blessing at a shrine, a way for Araci himself to be enchanted. These are passive effects that are usually permanent but require large offerings.

## Offerings
Most items in the game can be offered as a sacrifice at a Shrine. Each item will provide an amount of favor with a spirit or god, and possibly other benefits when offered. Favor can be used in exchange for enchantments, blessings, or pacts.
