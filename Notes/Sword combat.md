"In Suiō-ryū class, we were told that the older styles would begin their cut at the Yokote, or transition from straight to curved part. As it slices, the point of contact will move towards the Kissaki or tip.

The reason we are to do this is that we intentionally want a shallow cut, somewhere in the half-inch to two-inch range. Basically, just deep enough to cut the throat.

More modern styles cut with the Mono-Uchi, the “third of the blade that is closest to the Kissaki”. This makes it more effective when cutting tatami mats, but results in more of a ‘hacking’ action and a slice.

Additionally, the deeper you cut, the more likely you are to strike the wings of the Sode. The goal is to shallow enough to avoid the Sode, but still deep enough to injure the neck.

Of course, if someone is wearing a Nodowa (neck armor, like a gorget), then you wouldn’t target the neck at all and look for another opening."

In real fights, the goal is to deal a wound that will that will kill or disable. Common misconceptions in modern media hold weapons wrong, and misinterpret what kind of strikes are needed.
* Powerful strikes are slow, imprecise and easy to counter. They are mainly meant to overpower a parry or knock the opponent off balance.
* Jabs and thrusts are easy to counter but make very good counter attacks on their own. A single thrust to the body is usually enough to disable an opponent.
* Slicing attacks aim to hit with only the very tip of the sword. These attacks do not need a lot of power and can be done in quick succession. They can be just as damaging as a powerful swing.
* Keeping hands far apart on the handle allow for better leverage when swinging and allows more mobility. The main hand should be under the guard, and the off hand should be on the pommel.
* One handed weapons should be light and are rarely used with swinigng attacks. If the off hand is free, even a one handed weapon should be used with both hands if possible.
* Stances are used as start and endpoints for strikes, and each strike should be thought of as a transition between stances.

## Trivia
* Sparring or tournament sites were often euphemistically called "flower gardens" after the "flowers", or bruises, that one would often be covered in after a match.
* Symbolism of Firoe dei Libere: "...the Lynx  
(appearing to be a greyhound or deer wolf) for prudence, caution, or judgment, (prudentia or  
avisamento), the Tiger for celerity, quickness, or dexterity (celeritas or ardimento), the Lion for  
audacity or boldness and courage or bravery (audacia), and lastly the Elephant carrying a castle  
tower on its back for strength (fortitudo or forteza)."
