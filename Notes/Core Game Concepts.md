## Progression
Araci grows and becomes stronger in many different ways.
* Making offerings at shrines in exchange for Favor, a currency used for enchantments and blessings.
* Practicing with weapons and gaining experience over time
* Completing stories for unique rewards
* Finding powerful charms
* Cooking food for powerful temporary bonuses

Favor is like a currency that can be gained by making offerings or completing certain tasks. It can be used at shrines.

### Food
Food can be prepared or found and eaten. Eating food fills the Satiety meter. While there is no penalty for having an empty satiety meter, food can not be eaten with a full satiety meter.
When a food is eaten, it will add fullness to the satiety meter. Ass the meter lowers, the first food eaten will be reduced first. When that food's contribution to the meter disappears, its bonus is lost. The same food can be eaten multiple times and bonuses for that food will stack.
The Satiety meter has a fixed, discrete number of slots. Each food item takes a number of slots. The meter increases and decreases one slot at a time. Foods that take multiple satiety slots may reduce their effect as the meter is reduced.
