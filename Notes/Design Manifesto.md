#### Synonyms Are Bad
Words have contextual meaning, and add to cognitive load when playing a game. Avoid words that are synonymous or near synonymous in game terms:
* There should only be one damage over time effect and its name should be unique. Avoid fire, poison and bleed all at once or choose only one to be damage over time.
* Avoid Crits if other random chances for bonus damage exist. Choose one bonus source of damage. Chance to triple damage, Chance to backstab, Chance to kill, pick only one.
* Choose one source to mitigate damage. Dodge, evasion, phasing, luck

#### Words Are Better Than Numbers
Numbers mean math. Math is not fun.
Define things in terms of intuitive conditions. Give those conditions numerical values the player can see if necessary.
* Instead of a Strength stat, have a strength status. Weak, Average, Strong.
* Instead of an increased crit chance, make a player Lucky.

#### Random Is Lazy
Random chances do not give the player agency. They encourage retrying, gambling mentality. There are better ways to add variance to a game without randomization.
* Synergies between mechanics encourage players to explore the depth of how the mechanics interact
* Practicing a game and tailoring to the best players creates a high skill ceiling for players to aim for. Create alternate paths and areas only skilled players can access.
* Most AI is inherently random on some level, but often still predictable. Create more dynamic environments that allow AI agents to use a wider range of behaviours.
* Add weapons or other usable items that are hard to use properly without a good understanding of mechanics. Encourage replaying through practice.

#### Good Dialogue Is Valuable
Dialogue should not pad out the game. It should not exist just to create breathing room for the player. When a dialogue heavy event happens, the dialogue should be informative. It should give the player information that will help them in the game. 
* Lore exposition is not important, it's a waste of time
* Characters should be interesting and relatable, but also useful. The player should care if they die or disappear, and not just for emotional or narrative reasons. Every important character should have a value in the game.
* Dialogue sequences should be as short as possible. They should give the player information they need. All other dialogue is boring.
* Environmental dialogue (NPC chatter, player acknowledgement, narrator comments) should only exist insofar as they add to atmosphere. They should not be distracting or annoying.

#### Explosions Are Only Fun When I Make Them
* Explosions are cool
* Killing lots of enemies at once is awesome
* Explosions are hard to dodge (not fun)
* Visual indicators for explosion AOE looks bad and isn't a good solution. Causes anxiety and frustration if you can' move fast enough to escape the area
* Suicidal exploding enemies and homing rockets/missiles can and will ruin a game if overused.

#### Switching Weapons Is Not Fun
Each weapon has its own pacing and mentality when it's being used. Switching weapons mean switching playstyles, and this is rarely a good experience. Time to switch weapons ruins pacing.
Game examples that use weapon switching:
* The Witcher Iron Sword/Silver Sword. Separate upgrade trees, different playstyles, no synergy between the 2. The game is designed around requiring you to learn 2 playstyles and knowing when to switch between the 2. It sacrifices fluid gameplay for narrative reasons.
* Borderlands/Skul. Both game have mechanics based on giving you a bonus when switching weapons, to encourage you to switch weapons even when not necessary. This isn't fun, switchign weapons adds nothing to the game and forcing it with bonuses makes me want to avoid that part of the game entirely.
* Doom 2016/Eternal use limited ammo to force players to switch weapons a lot during a fight, to encourage a varied playstyle so the game doesn't get monotonous, in theory. This isn't necessary. Compare to the Half Life series, which offers you over a dozen weapons and enough ammo for them all. Players still find reasons to switch weapons for different situations, without being forced to. Good level design will encourage varying weapon choices.

#### All Stories Should Be Connected To Each Other And The Game
No story should exist on its own. They should instead be vignettes that tie together into a larger narrative theme and arc of the game itself. Each story arc should progress the larger story or provide some sort of exposition to the player. To help solidify this concept:
* All stories should depend on other stories before they can be started, or have other stories depend on them
* All main stories, linear or not, should end with new gameplay opportunities or a significant change to the game state or environment to anchor them to the game itself
* Optional stories should complement main stories and provide alternate storylines or add extra parts to those stories
* If a character only appears for a single story they should be referenced outside this story, or if they are complete strangers their mark should be left on the world somehow after they are gone
* If a major event happens outside of a storyline it should be acknowledged in future stories
* The player gaining stronger in-game (levelling up, acquiring resources, gaining influence with characters) should be a part of the main story line.
