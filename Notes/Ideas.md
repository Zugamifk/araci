## Food
* Mana is used for magic
* Food replenishes health and mana and can give other bonuses
* Food is the main way to replenish mana, does not replenish passively
* Food is "crafted" with collected ingredients -- Eastward
* Foods can be combined to combine their effects
### Cooking
Cooking can transform a food or enhance its effects. Coking can also be a process for combining foods into new foods.

* Roasting is the most basic form of cooking, done over a fire with no other type of ingredients. Only plants and meats can be roasted.
* Boiling requires a container and water. Faster than roasting.
* Frying requires a container and oil. Even faster than boiling.
* Infusing requires more precise tools and processing to create. They require an oil to infuse and a spice or hearb to infuse with.
* Fermenting requires an ingredient with sugar and takes a very long time to create. Only way to create alcohol.

### Ingredients
Different ingredients are important for different cooking processes and recipes.

## Alternate Present Day Sory
Araci is a old man with a fading memory. He has kept the story of the demons and the assassin secret for his entire life, thinking no one will believe him. As he's grown older, he feels as though he's going mad anyway, and let out hints of his younger years to his family one night. His family, interested, has encouraged him to write a memoir. The playthroughs of the "past" are the runs of the main game. Each time araci fails, the story fades back to the present day with the old man saying "No, it couldn't have gone like that". When he succeeds he says "Yes! That was it!". Then the narrative moves forward with a new piece of information given.

## Revenge Arc

Araci's village is attacked by a mysterious group of armed men. They kill everyone, and in the opening scene, execute Araci. Luckily, Araci doesn't die. A stranger finds him and tends his wounds, saving his life. The stranger informs Araci that the men were demon hunters, bandits who search for places where demons are found and terrorize and plunder everything in their path. Their leader is an infamous warrior, and he is the one who conducted the execution on Araci. The stranger tells Araci he was one a close acquaintance of the leader, and knows him and his motivations well. He asks Araci if he wants vengeance, and gives Araci his sword, telling him where he thinkgs the leader will go next.

Ultimately, Araci never finds the leader though he may run into some of the other demon hunters. Each defeated demon hunter drops a clue about their leader and who he is. Once Araci has killed each of the demon hunters at least once and collected all of the clues, an event occurs in the present day where old Araci finally makes a connection and discovers who the leader is. He is someone Araci is acquainted with in the present day. A final confrontation between them should happen in the present day.

## Mystery Trails

A series of clues lead to mysterious treasures throughout the world. Each clue is a scroll with either an image or text describing the location of the next clue. At the end of each trail is a special reward, along with a clue about the location of the start of each of the other trails.
Each clue describes a unique landmark or object and the clue will always be under it, although the meaning of "under" may be used in a very broad way.
Some examples of clues:
* A large outcropping extending over a cliff. The treasure lies at the base of the cliff.
* A tree with a unique shape. The clue is buried in a cleft in the tree.
* A unique enemy. The clue is dropped to the ground when the enemy is killed.
* A large boulder. The clue is underneath the boulder. Possible also buried in the ground.
* A circle of trees. The clue is buried in the center of the circle.
* A Large banner. The treasure is held by an enemy who also carries the banner.
* A coat of arms. The treasure is sealed in a tomb bearing the coat of arms.

## Dance as a Theme
As an ongoing theme in the game, dancing should appear, along with music. Enemies and NPCs should often move as though they are dancing. The sounds of the environment and different creatures should synchronize to create music naturally. Focus on bright colours and high contrast.
An important technical challenge would be finding a way to track footprints without fading them over time. Different creatures have different footprints. Similarly, attacks or other damaging effects on objects should stay if the object is not destroyed. Debris should stay on the ground and be swept away by the wind into piles. Seasons change, and weather effects changes constantly. Non-environmental sounds should be natural sounding effects like drums, wood or stone strikes, scraping, jingling, ringing.
Enemies should not be immediately hostile, but instead go about their natural paths. They should only attack the player if given the opportunity, though they may stalk the player. Even demons follow this nature, though their world, sounds, style, will stand out as very different from the normal world.
The Assassin and the Sorcerers are consumed with narcissism and do not follow these rules. Their movements are stiff, they have dark colours, and they leave a clear trail of destruction and corruption in their wake, though that effect will fade over time. 
Araci wears a cloak that is highly animated with the wind and his movements. While moving normally, his arms and hands are hidden under the cloak, but when he is attacking or being hurt, his arms come out and are always visible. This transition should fit the transition in tone between movement and combat.

## Alternative Progression
As this idea fleshes out and more stories are added, the rogue-like system feels poorly suited for a narrative heavy game. Restarting constantly, even in a fully open world, may not be the best approach. Maybe weigh pros and cons of different progression systems.
### Rogue-Like
The player restarts from the beginning each time they die, losing most, if not all, progression.
#### Pros
* Allows a level of procedural generation to allow the player to rediscover old areas in a new way
* Allows players to play many different builds to fully explore the character progression system to find a build that works for them
* Allows the game to be designed in a much broader way where the palyer is never expected to fully explore the world in a single run, even if they do finish the game
#### Cons
* Requires much more content generation. Procedural level content, wider variety of skills and items to use.
* Much more repetition as players are guarenteed to fight the same enemies and use the smae items over and over
* Frustrating to lose when the game feels unfair and player has to start from the beginning.
* Stories have to be constructed in a way where they can be interrupted partway and either continued later or started over. Much more consideration needed for how narrative is constructed.
### Save Points (FromSoft style)
Create specific points in the world where the player is allowed to save. If the player dies, they must restart from these points.
#### Pros
* Careful level design allows placing these points before large linear sections or difficult encounters.
* Still provides a level of challenge as the player must reach the next save point without dying.
* Can be hidden. Could be Shrines, similar to bonfires in Souls games.
#### Cons
* Limits level design to smaller open sections, otherwise savepoint have to be placed in easily findable ways.
* May create a false sense of security where players play for long periods without remembering to save. Could lead to losing a lot of progress on death.
### Free Saving with Autosave
Players can save whenever they want. Autosave happens at regular time intervals and at certain specific points in the game.
#### Pros
* The safest way to make sure players do not lose progress.
#### Cons
* Allows "savescumming". May make the game too easy.

### Possible Hybrid
* Save points are Shrines.
* Shrines can only be saved at once, and are automatically activated when found.
* Each shrine save is a separate save file, so players can backtrack to previous saves if they are unhappy with their current path.
* A map can be used to track a player's path from shrine to shrine. Travelling back to previous save points could offer interesting narrative opportunities.

## Araci's Belongings
Old Araci has sold most of his old belongings in order to pay his bills. Celeste is trying to find them to help job Araci's memory. Each item she returns to him unlocks an item Young Araci finds and uses it in the next vignette.
