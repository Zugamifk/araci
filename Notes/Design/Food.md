Food is created at a cooking zone. A cooking zone contains:
* A container, which the final product is prepared in and taken from.
* A preparation area, where ingredients can be processed before being added to the container
* A heat source, which the container can be add to to apply heat.
Additionally, other containers can be used for subipreparations. Essentially, each food item can be concidered a "perparation", where a final food is taken from. Some food items can be used as ingredients for subsequent preparations. 

Ingredients can be taken from the player's inventory and don't need to be part of a cooking area. All available ingredients are what is in the player's inventory.

Some preparations require special tools. Chopping requires a knife. Grinding requires a mortar and pestle.

The interface for cooking contains the ollowing items:
* A title, with the closest and best name for the current preparation in its current state.
* A list of ingredients contained in the preparation
* A list of available ingredients in the inventory
* A space for processing the current igredient if it needs to be processed.
