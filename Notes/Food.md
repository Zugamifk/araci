Cooking is one of the two main crafting systems in the game. Food ingredients can be gathered from the environment and from fallen enemies. Cooking can be done at any shrine, camp fire, or specialized cooking spots such as ovens, kitchen, or labs.

Rather than using a hunger system, this game uses a "Fullness" system. You are able to consume only a certain amount of food at a time, then it needs to be digested over time. As long as food is being digested, it will provide certain effects to Araci (or anyone who eats it). Learning to cook means learning what different ingredients do, and how processing them in different ways enhances or changes those effects. Combining certain ingredients can create new ingredients. While food can be eaten at any stage of the cooking process, a finished meal will usually provide the best effects.

Food does not spoil and can be kept indefinitely, though food will lose the Freshness quality after a period of time.

## Cooking
There are many different processes for preparing ingredients for cooking. All food have certain  traits that their effects depends on.

## Ingredients

### Extracts

## Processes
### **Roasting** 
Cooking over a constant heat. Usually enhances the effects of the ingredient.

### **Boiling**
Cooking in a boiling liquid. Usually infuses the ingredients being boiled together.

### Frying
Cooking in oil at high heat. Will cook quickly.

### **Chopping** 
Breaking into smaller pieces. Does not usually have an effect on its own, but is an intermediate step for cooking. Chopped ingredients take less time to cook.

### **Mashing**
Breaking into a paste. Only wet ingredients can be mashed. Mixes items if they are mashed together. Mashed ingredients cook very quickly.

### **Grinding** 
Breaking into a powder. Only dry ingredients can by ground. Can infuse a liquid by mixing without boiling.

### **Infusing**
Extracting essential flavors and chemicals from one ingredient into another, often an oil. When an ingredient has been infused, it an be removed and the infused ingredient will contain all the properties of both ingredients.

### **Reducing**
Boiling until most or all liquid disappears. Redusing will infuse the solid ingredients with the properties of the liquid.

### **Mixing**
Combine two ingredients into a new ingredient. Any two ingredients can be combined, but Mixing specifically refers to a process of creating a new ingredient out of two others. Infusing and Reducing are two examples of Mixing. Adding a powder or paste to a liquid, or combining powders and liquids also will mix them. Mixed ingredients can not be separated.

### **Fermenting**
Letting an ingredient in a liquid with sugar sit until alcohol forms. Letting sit longer can create vinegar. Fermenting can not be done in a single sitting. Foods that can ferment will become fermented after a fixed period of time.

### **Pickling** 
Infusing an ingredient with vinegar or brine. Unlike most infusing processes, pickling can be done without heat but will take a long time similar to fermenting.
