Cooking is one of the two main crafting systems in the game. Food ingredients can be gathered from the environment and from fallen enemies. Cooking can be done at any shrine, camp fire, or specialized cooking spots such as ovens, kitchen, or labs.

Rather than using a hunger system, this game uses a "Fullness" system. You are able to consume only a certain amount of food at a time, then it needs to be digested over time. As long as food is being digested, it will provide certain effects to Araci (or anyone who eats it). Learning to cook means learning what different ingredients do, and how processing them in different ways enhances or changes those effects. Combining certain ingredients can create new ingredients. While food can be eaten at any stage of the cooking process, a finished meal will usually provide the best effects.

Food does not spoil and can be kept indefinitely, though food will lose the Freshness quality after a period of time.
