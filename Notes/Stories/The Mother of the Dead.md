### Cast
* Mother of the Dead

In a forest, deep in a valley, a parade of ghost travels, wandering randomly. They have no destination, no leaders, and they never stop. They parade is made up of all sorts, peasant, nobles, soldiers, horses, and even some fantastical creature. 

Surrounding the parade is a chilling aura that condenses the air into fog, and then freezes fog into frost. Anyone living entering the parade will die, except for one woman.  This woman lives in the forest and seems oblivious to the parade, and walks through it without noticing its presense. When Araci meets her and the parade for the first time, she is harvesting plants as they walk past her. She notices Araci and beckons them to her. Araci has been warned about the parade beforehand and waits for them to leave before apporaching. She is unhappy about this and asks Araci if they fear her. She worries she has been called a witch. 

She invites Araci back to her home where she begins to cook dinner. Her house is filled with charms and  protective wards, though they are not obvious unless Araci knows what to look for. Most of these wards take the form of  symbols and juxtapositions. Outside, there is a firepit a  good distance from the house. The firepit is in a clear area and has signs of having been used recently, as well as having the ground around it well worn down. 

The woman warns Araci that the forest is a dangerous place for the living. She says she has heard stories that lost souls and even the undead roam the area. They will attack on sight of the living unless they are well protected. She explains how her wards protect her. She reveals that she is blind.

Araci and the woman eat as night falls. She invites Araci to stay the night. That night, Araci is woken up by the woman getting up from bed and leaving the house. Araci follows her into the forest where she approaches a shrine, except this is no ordinary shrine. The grass here is covered in frost and it is surrounded by graves. She approaches the shrine, lights a candle, picks up a bowl and eats something from it. The parade appears nearby. She turns and beckons to Araci. Ghosts begin to rise from the graves and join the parade, which begins to circle the shrine.

When Araci enters the circle of graves, the candle at the shrine goes out. The parade stops moving and all turn to face Araci. The woman leaps up from the shrine and charges at Araci to attack. They fight. After Araci deals her a killing blow, she and the ghosts of the parade immediately vanish. The candles of the shrine suddenly light. The graves are revealed to be nothing but bushes and trees.  The shrine is now usable as a normal shrine.

If Araci tries to return to the woman's house, it will be gone. 

Araci may encounter the woman again in the forest in the future.  She will not recognize Araci.
