### Summary
Old Araci awakens from a dream sequence.  

*In this dream we see How Araci Died.*

His memories are leaving him. He is angry, grumpy, bitter and reclusive. The only person he trusts is his daughter Celeste.

Today there will be a festival, which means noise. He is in an especially sour mood. He expresses his displeasure at the idea of the festival to Celeste in the morning she comes to serve him breakfast. Celeste asks him if she can help to keep him busy. He asks for a journal to record his dream, she agrees to bring him one.

Today, his tea is different. It tastes like a tea he used to make. When he was young.

Old Araci has tried his best to forget the memories of the past. He has been happy to lose them in his old age, but the tea has awoken something in him. He asks Celeste what she put in the tea. She mentions *Special Tea Ingredient*. He asks her how she found it and she admits she didnt, *Special Tea Ingredient Vendor* was selling it at a market. He tells her it is very rare and would very much like to meet him. She notices he seems more lively at this idea so she promises to.

When she later arrives with the vendor. He enters and, realizing he is meeting Araci, immediately bows in respect and asks why Araci has summoned him. Araci asks him where he found *Special Tea Ingredient*. *Special Tea Ingredient Vendor* admits there is a secret place that his family has been collecting from for generations. Araci nods and says he knows the place. 

*We now play How Araci Learned To Cook.*

After the story, the vendor is speechless. He graciously thanks Araci for sharing the story and tells him he should record it in his journal. It is a legendary story and should be shared with future generations. Araci stays silent but evenutally nods. The vendor leaves. 

Outside Araci overhears the vendor speaking with Celeste. He suggests that araci was once a great hunter. Celeste admits most of his old belongings have been sold to pay bills, but that she wishes she could find his old bow.

The day ends and Araci goes to sleep.  In the morning Celeste arrives with breakfast, and a large packet of *Special Tea Ingredient*. She says it is a gift from the vendor, a token of appreciation for sharing his story.
