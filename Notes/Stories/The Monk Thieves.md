Two monks live in diffrent sections of the cloister. Each's duty is to maintain a different gallery full of valuable artifacts of historical importance to the order.

On event over dinner one of the monks bets the other that that can steal an artifact from their gallery without anyone, including the monk, noticing.

The monks agree to the bet, and soon an artifact goes missing. The next day over dinner, one monk congratulates the other for successfully stealing the artifact, but the other monk denies it, saying he hasn't attempted to steal anything yet. The two argue and the argument get heated. The two monks part ways, each suspicious of the other.

Soon, and artifact goes missing from the other monk's gallery. Furious, the two monks meet again,  hurling accusations, both denying the accusations.
