### Summary
#### Part 1
A massive stone viaduct crosses a valley, passing over a large forest and through a large temple complex in the center of the valley. The viaduct has bridge sections held up by multiple towers and massive cables like a suspension bridge (*revise this, suspension bridges shouldn't exist*).

After events in a separate story, the viaduct is destroyed and the bridges collapse into the forest and temple complex below. The towers fall, destroying large sections of the countryside, and the cable, stressed by the collapse, eventually snap and whip through the valley and forest, destroying even more.

As a result of the collapse, the temple is exacuated and many of the monks and high priests (*terminology?*) rush into the forest, where many and killed or abucted by demons and other wildlife. Araci finds the body of *Temple High Priest* carrying the keys to an Inner Cloister of the temple. On his way to the inner cloister, Araci encounters many other priests rushing their way out. *Certain Temple Warrior* recognizes Araci and tries to stop him entering. *Certain Temple Warrior* commands the monks to stop Araci, and eventually fights Araci himself when they fail. (*Does Certain Temple warrior die here?*)

When Araci enters the inner cloister he finds the atmosphere is much more calm. Most of the monks and high priests here don't notice Araci and assume he is expected to be there.  *There should be an important revelation here. Araci meets Important Temple Character who shows him a secret passage to an underground section of the templ complex*

Araci explores the area via a complex series of lifts which eventually lead him to the top area which used to connect to the viaduct. In a room here he overhears *Ruin Architect* and *Ruined Island Excavation Leader* discussing an alternate location to move the priesthood. The location is on an island in an ancient ruin, that he proposes could be rebuilt. The ruin is said to contain an ancient source of power that could be used to repair the temple complex and the viaduct.

#### Part 2
Araci arives at the island with the ruin. (*Clarify motivation for coming here*) There he finds many of the remaining priests. Some are building the ruin, others are attempting to excavate buried areas, trying to find the promised power source. 

Araci once again meets *Important Temple Character*. If Araci explored the underground area before coming here and tells them about it, *Important Temple Character* will betray Araci and attempt to trap him somewhere in the ruins where he will have a longer more dangerous route to his goal at the island.

If Araci is not betrayed, *Important Temple Character* will take him to a special office in one of the ruined towers. *Important Temple Character* will leave Araci here and go back on his own. As Araci explores this area he encounters a standoff between a *Ruin Architect* and *Ruin Assassin*. The assassin quickly kills the Priest before noticing Araci and fleeing.

If Araci chooses to chase the Assassin, the Assassin will run to a ruined balcony with a makeshift elevator. If he notices Araci he will turn to face Araci. If they fight, Araci will notice he can not kill the Assassin even after dealing a mortal blow. If Araci retreats after dealing a mortal blow, the Assassin will turn and take the elevator down and disappear.

The *Ruin Architect*'s body is carrying an *Important Ruin Island Item*.

Regardless of whether Araci is betrayed or not, he will eventually be led to an excavation site where monks are on the verge of uncovering a large underground chamber. As Araci arrives, a large collapse occurs and a large hole collapses, revealing an entrance to the chamber from the ceiling. The floor is far, far below and the extents of the chamber aren't fully visible.

*Possible addition* 
Several of the excavators fall with the collapse and can be heard below crying out. Shortly after, they cries suddenly go quiet. When Araci eventually reaches the bottom of the chamber, the excavators are nowhere to be found.
-

The excavators quickly anchor ropes to climb down into the chamber. At the bottom the chamber is revealed to be a massive, long, ornate gallery. The walls are painted red and engraved with motifs depicting the *Great Historical Event At The Ruined Island*. One side of the gallery is collapsed, but the other has a doorway at the end.

Through the gallery door is a large atrium. In the centre of the atrium is the *Ruined Island Power Source*. The *Ruined Island Excavation Leader* tells and excavator to summon the *Ruin Architect*, who is dead. The excavator returns with *Important Ruin Island Item*. If Araci has already witnessed the killing, he may inform the Excavation Leader himself and reveal *Important Ruin Island Item*. Otherwise he may take time to explore the area (*Is there anythign to find?*)

*Important Ruin Island Item* is an important key to activating the *Ruined Island Power Source*. (*How?*)

After the *Ruined Island Power Source* is activated the Viaduct is is partially, but not fully, restored. Seeing this, *Ruined Island Excavation Leader*, now presumed leader of the *Ruin Island* expedition, is dismayed. The power source seems to have reversed much of the damage of the collapse and certain sections have been rebuilt but seem to be held up be some outside force, likely the power source.

#### Part 3
Araci returns to the Viaduct and attempts to cross it.
He meets *Group of Travellers* camping at one end. They witnessed the reconstruction of the viaduct. They inform Araci that there seems to be chaos below in the temple complex.

*From here, the story ends depending on the initial cause of the collapse. Some Ideas for the cause:*
* Sabotauge. A group of of saboteurs intentionally destroyed the viaduct in order to gain access to the inner cloister, perhaps the underground area. Perhaps *Certain Temple Warrior* and *Important Temple Character* are two of these saboteurs. Perhaps the *Group of Travellers* are the saboteurs. *Suggested resolution: The saboteurs are now looting the inner cloister and attempting to enter the underground complex. They may or may not succeed depending on if Araci has already entered it.*
* A linked destructive event elsewhere triggers the destruction here. Perhaps the temple tower is connected to another location. After a terrible event there occurs (the death of a powerful being, the destruction of an important object), a magical explosion or other sort of event occurs at teh viaduct, leading to its collapse. *Suggested resolution: The power source has broken the connection the temple had with the other location. In fact, the power source is drawing power from the temple. The Temple itself has lost most of its power and is now of no use to the priesthood.*
* A Sorcerer or *The Sorcerer Assassin* deliberately destroy it to stop Araci from accessing the Inner cloister. This should be related to the *Important Temple Character* informing Araci about the underground complex. Perhaps *Important Temple Character* is a Sorcerer. *Suggested resolution: The Temple complex is now completely empty. The Sorcerer or Assassin now wait for Araci in the Inner cloister, possibly in the underground complex, knowing he will return. They will fight here.*
* A major weather event. Depending on the scale of power at Araci's disposal at this point in the game, it may be possible that his actions lead to the collapse. It may be an entirely unintentional, emergent event leading to the initial story. *Suggested resolution: Nothing. The Group of Travellers remark they saw what Araci did, and believe he is a powerful Sorcerer. This may lead to him being hunted by The Sorcerer Asssassin. The story ends here.*
