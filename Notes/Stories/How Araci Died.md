* *Strange Healer* - from the *Group of Travellers*
* *A Smart Man* - from the *Group of Travellers*

Araci is on a boat, returning to his village with the day's catch. As they pull their boat into the dock they notices a fire in the village and no movement. rushing into the village, they find houses on fire, the bodies of villagers and animals, belongings and other debris strewn all over the place. In front of the village shrine stands a group of 5 armed men, the *Village Bandits*.

They notice Araci and taunt them, and telling them to come over. They say that there was nothing in the village worth taking and challenge Araci to a duel for their entertainment. On of the guards tosses a sword in front of Araci, demanding they pick it up, while another one steps forward with his sword drawn. The other 4 bandits form a circle around the two and the challenger then moves towards Araci. 

Araci then fights the bandit in a scripted fight where they are shortly mortally wounded and fall to the ground. The 5 bandits, disappointed, mock Araci for being so weak. One bandit comes to take his sword back, spitting on Araci as he leaves. The 5 *Village Bandits* then leave the village.

As Araci's vision blurs, a figure appears at the edge of the houses, and moves towards Araci as the screen fades to black.

*The black screen remains for a while. The sound of a beating heart slowly fades in and suddenly a  new scene fades in*.

Araci is lying on the ground next to a camp fire, bundled in blankets. A figure sits on the other side of the fire with their back to them.  Both are silent.

The figure eventually turns around, holding a small bowl and notices Araci is awake. They pause before getting up and slowly moving towards Araci. They kneel in front of Araci and upen the blankets, revealing Araci's bandage wound. They remove the bandage and tend to the wound, then replace the bandage and get up, returning to their seat across the fire.

They inform Araci that their wounds are closed but they are not fully healed. They ask Araci if they are hungry. Araci nods and the stranger fills a bowl of something from a pot over the fire, then brings it to Araci.

As Araci eats, they introduce themselves. They are part of a *Group of Travellers*. Their companions are currently off tracking the bandits, while the healer stayed behind to tend to Araci. It has been 3 weeks since the attack on Araci's village. The healer was foraging nearby when the attack happened. When they heard the noise, they came to investigate. They witnessed the murders and  pillaging happen. They watched Araci enter and fight the bandit leader, then came to save Araci after the bandits left.

They tell Araci they are currently camped at the *Group of Travellers*' base camp, waiting for the return of the others. They have also been gone for 3 weeks, but they are expected to return. They tell Araci to rest, that there is no use rushing to return the to the village. There are no other survivors there. They should wait for the return of the others.

The healer goes silent and fetches themselves a bowl of food from the pot over the fire. They eat in silence.

*The screen fades to black again. A new scene fades in. A fastforward through 3 days, where the healer leaves and returns to the camp to forage, tends to Araci, feeds Araci, and tends to the camp. Araci rests in the bed the entire time, tossing and turning through the day, increasingly so as the days pass. The screen fades to black again. When it fades back in, it's morning. Araci is sitting up and the rest of the Group of Travellers has just arrived at the camp*

The healer acknowledges Araci's recovery as the other from the group share information about the bandits. They tracked them to another nearby village where they are currently camping. It seems the bandits are in a disagreement about what to do next as they have found next to nothing in their raids. They are afraid to travel to the mainland because of stories of demons roaming the lands there.

*A Smart Man* from the group confirms he has heard stories of demons there. It's been a while since they have been to the mainland and they only know this speaking to others who have recently crossed over. 

One of the other travellers looks at Araci and asks them if they are comfortable standing. Araci attempts to stand, wavers, and eventually falls back to their knees. The traveller laughs and turns to their horse, pulling out a sword. Araci immediately recoils. The traveller walks up to Araci and hands it to Araci calmly. Araci apprehensively takes the sword. The traveller tells them that as soon as they are able to walk, they will help train Araci to use a sword. Then they will hunt the bandits down.
