The demon, being much stronger and faster than most humans, never loses. While resting at an inn, he shares the story of he's never met his match in a duel and wishes to find a great sword master to teach him and take him under his wing. And old scholar approaches him, telling him there is a great library full of texts depicting the martial arts. Perhaps he can track down the authors and find them that way.  Thankfully, the demon agrees and together they journey to the library. On the way, the demon reveals his true nature to the scholar. The scholar answers that he has already suspected this. At the library, it's revealed that the scholar is the author of the texts. To test his skill, the demon attacks the scholar, who easily defends himself and puts the demon at his mercy.
