*The possessed person could be a member of the group of travellers. Perhaps they are travelling to find a cure for the possession?*

A demon has taken possession of someone's body. They've been captured and imprisoned by their associates and are currently being held in a building outside of the local village out of fear the villagers will try to kill them.

The demon is mostly dormant and allows the person to speak for themselves most of the time. They do not have any memories of their actions when the demon is in control and are very scared to learn that a demon has possessed them. While their associates work to find a cure, the demon listens.

Unbeknownst to the others, the demon is able to communicate with other demons outside this body, and relays the information it collects to the others. This leads to some plans going wrong, an ambush, a betrayal, etc. Soon they begin to suspect the demon, or even that their friend has been decieving them.

Soon the group falls into a major disagreement with one side wanting to killed the possessed which the others believe they can still be saved. This leads to a major conflict that causes one side to kill the other. Araci's actions may influence which side succeeds.
