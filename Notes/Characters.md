# Araci
## Young Araci
His village was destroyed by demons. He is on a quest to close the portals and kill the last demon.
Specializes in Katanas, Bombs, and natural magics.

Araci is not a skilled warrior or mage. He learns new skills as the game progresses. His exact set of skills depends on player progression of the character, through choices made at chrines and through the story.

Araci could be non-binary. Araci is usually depicted wearing a long orange cloak covering his arms and most of his body. The cloak has intricate patterns around its base. He has long sholder-length hair, a blue shirt and yellow pants with simple leather boots.

As the game progresses, Araci may collect charms that will be worn on the outside of the cloak.
