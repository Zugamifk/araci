## Araci
### Young Araci
Araci is not a skilled warrior or mage. They learn new skills as the game progresses. Their exact set of skills depends on player progression of the character, through choices made at shrines and through the story.

Araci is non-binary. Araci is usually depicted wearing a long orange cloak covering their arms and most of their body. The cloak has intricate patterns around its base. They have long sholder-length hair, a blue shirt and yellow pants with simple leather boots.

As the game progresses, Araci may collect charms that will be worn on the outside of the cloak.

* Genichiro, *Sekiro*

## Celeste
Araci's daughter in the present day. She is the one who encourages Araci to record his memories. As she sees him find more inspiration in writing, she brings him gifts to motivate him and help him jog his memory. These gifts have an effect on the game and story of the past.

Generally, Araci keeps his past from everyone, but especially Celeste (*Why?*). Instead, any story he shares in the present day is told to other characters and written in the book she brings him. Those characters share hints of what they heard to Celeste, which inspires her to bring him his next gift.

These discussions should happen at the start and end of different stories.

* *Donovan* One bandit is an expert hunter. He is unsure he wants to be a bandit, but is afraid to leave the group. The leader suspects this.
* *Marcie/Marnie* One bandit is very happy to serve under the leader, who lets him carry out the most monstrous deeds he wants without punishment.
