# Araci
## Young Araci
His village was destroyed by demons. He is on a quest to close the portals and kill the last demon.
Specializes in Katanas, Bombs, and natural magics.

Araci is not a skilled warrior or mage. He learns new skills as the game progresses. His exact set of skills depends on player progression of the character, through choices made at chrines and through the story.

Araci could be non-binary. Araci is usually depicted wearing a long orange cloak covering his arms and most of his body. The cloak has intricate patterns around its base. He has long sholder-length hair, a blue shirt and yellow pants with simple leather boots.

As the game progresses, Araci may collect charms that will be worn on the outside of the cloak.

# The Sorcerer Assassin

# Celeste
Araci's daughter in the present day. She is the one who encourages Araci to record his memories. As she sees him find more inspiration in writing, she brings him gifts to motivate him and help him jog his memory. These gifts have an effect on the game and story of the past.

Generally, Araci keeps his past from everyone, but especially Celeste (*Why?*). Instead, any story he shares in the present day is told to other characters and written in the book she brings him. Those characters share hints of what they heard to Celeste, which inspires her to bring him his next gift.

These discussions should happen at the start and end of different stories.
