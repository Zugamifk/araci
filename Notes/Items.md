These are all the items that can be found in the game

# Weapons
## Longsword
This is Araci's main weapon, found early in the game. It has a pretty simple and consistent set of attacks that are easy to learn. The key to mastering the longsword it to learn to time your attacks to parry the enemy or strike them before they strike you. It is better to play in an aggressive style than a defensive style with this weapon. It allows for a very mobile style of combat. 

## Hunting Bow
This is Araci's main ranged weapon. Giving to him by the *Group of Travellers*, he uses it mainly for hunting. It is very useful for ambushing enemies, but due to relatively slow fire rate and low mobility while wielding it, it is not suitable for combat. 

## Pots
These areweapons that can be crafted and are meant to be used as ranged weapons in combat. Though only a limited amount can be carried at a time, they have a wide range of effects and can be enchanted for even stronger effects.
