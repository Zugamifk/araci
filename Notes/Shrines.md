Shrines exist throughout the world and are places for Araci to rest and recuperate. Each shrine is unique but has some common identifying features:
* A statue of a god or spirit
* Candles and lights on either side
* An open shelter without walls
* A camp site wia fire or cooking area
* Many colourful banners, lanterns, or flags

When resting at a shrine, many actions are available.
* If the candles are not lit, they can be lit to save the game. They will eventually go out over time.
* Give an offering at the statue. Depending on the offering, the gods will grant Araci with an amount of magical power.
