## Lake of Worms
A lake swarming with flesh eating worms. The water level rises and sinks with the rains, and mostly the worms feast on carrion near the lake's edge when the water rises. 

Occasionally a living creature wander into the lake. The worms may consume them entirely, but often they will instead infest the body, eating many of its muscles and organs but keeping the host alive, forming a symbiotic relationship. Eventually, the host will begin to deteriorate and the worms will explode from the body consuming everything in the area.

It is believed that the worms share a single consciousness and it's been told that some of the worm walkers will try to bring other living creatures to the lake to be consumes. It its believed that at the bottom of the lake is an irmous being, an algamation of all the body ever drawn into the lake, bound and infested with the worms.
