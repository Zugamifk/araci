### Bright Colors
* High contrast and bright colors. Lots of color on black, and shapes should all have black outlines.
* Flat colors and little if no shading.
* Use black lines to add texture if needed.
* Avoid putting similar colors next to each other
* Try to separate different bright hues with dark hues or black
* Dark hues should never be next to each other
* Juxtapose cool and warm colors
* Avoid white
* Avoid pastel colors
* Never use fully saturated colors

### Simple Shapes
* Circles, square, triangles
* Zigzags, simple curves, straight lines
* Animated effects like fire, lightning, smoke should be as solid as possible. Avoid multiple particles,
* Waving objects should move in fairly simple s-shaped waves instead of chaotically

### Simple Animation
* Follow Disney's 12 principles of animation for motion.
* All movement should be obvious, no subtle movements.
* Idle animations should not be a movement of a character's body unless it is very pronounced. Prefer movement of hair, fur, clothing.
* Avoid light effects like shadows, beams, haloes, sparkles

### Simple Audio
* Every sound should have an obvious source
* Sounds should have a clear start and end. Avoid echoes or fading.
* Ambient sounds should have an intuitive source. Natural sounds should sound like animals, wind, etc.
* Mysterious sounds should have a source that can be followed or investigated and have visual cues that they can be associated with.

### Emergent Music
* Each sound should fall on a beat timing.
* Objects that make repeating sounds should make them in a regular rhythm
* Multiple ambient sounds should harmonize
* Percussive sounds should mimic drums, blocks, chimes, or other percussive instruments
* Melodic sounds should play in notes
* Actual instruments should lead the other sounds
* Longer sounds playing over each other should play in different harmonizing pitches
