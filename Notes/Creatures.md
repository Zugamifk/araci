The world is full of different wildlife, demons, and spirits. Most of them are benign, and act according to their nature. Many are opportunistic and will attack Araci if given the chance. Some are defensive and will only attack when cornered. Some can be summoned or will attack when commanded to.

## Wildlife
These are normal, natural creatures that exist in the physical world like humans do.

## Spirits
Spirits are creatures who come from the Fae world. They are usually friendly, but many are mischevious and will try to mislead Araci or guide him into danger. Often they will possess wildlife and make them act erratically, or use them to communicate with humans. Spirits come in many varieties, but most are invisible except in certain conditions.

## Demons
Demons come from the Ethereal realm and have travelled to the mortal realm through the portals opened by the Sorcerers. They are mostly harmless if left undisturbed, but they are also powerful creatures who are not afraid to attack if necessary. Demons come in many varieties and most of them have been sent to the mortal realm with a mission from their Lord Demon.
