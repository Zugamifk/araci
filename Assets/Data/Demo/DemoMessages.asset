  - Welcome to the demo!
  - In the Update loop, the View updates according to the model
  - The model contains all the important state of the game
  - The ViewModel is a readonly version of the model that the View has access to
  - Commands are used to modify the model
  - The messages are stored in a scriptable object
  - Pressing the button sends a command to increment the current message index and
    load the next message from data into the model
