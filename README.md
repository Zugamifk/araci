## Story
Years ago, a group of powerful sorcerers created a portal to another realm. They entered the portal and each made a pact with a different powerful demon. They were each granted some of the demon's power, and in return they were cursed, that if any one of them were killed the killer would become stronger. if only one remained they would be dragged back to the demon realm, enslaved to the demon whose power they possessed. Terrified and paranoid of each other, they agreed to part ways and never to meet again. The sorcerers lived mostly in peace, studying their craft and the demon's gifts on their own. 

Today, something has changed. Someone has been killing the sorceres, stealing their power and using it to open more portals to the demon realm, allowing demons to enter. The demons have been possessing animals and objects, or entering in their physical forms. They have left death and destruction in their wake.

Araci's village is attacked and destroyed by demons. In the wake of the destruction, Araci finds himself praying at a shrine for a blessing to help him survive and fight the demons back. A wandering soldier walks by, offering Araci a weapon, saying he is too weak-willed and weak-minded to fight the demons himself. He gives Araci his blessing and tell him to go to another village where a portal has appeared, spilling otu the demons that attacked his village. He tells araci that he can destroy the portal by killing the demon who is keeping it open.

So the story begins...

## Summary
Araci is hunting demons to kill to shut portals. He is also hunting the sorcerers who he discovers are also helping to create the portals. Each time he kills a sorcerer, he is granted a gift from the sorcerer's demon, growing stronger. As he travels the world, Araci discovers clues about the assassin who has also been killing sorcerers. In a final conflict, Araci faces the assassin and kills them. He is then dragged to the demon realm where he must face the demon who intends to enslave him.

Throughout the adventure, Araci meets characters who will give him quests for rewards. Some of these are offerings which can be offered at shrine to grant new abilities, heal wounds, or make powerful pacts. As Araci fights, he gains experience with his weapon and learns new techniques. 

Araci will meet an animal who bonds with him as a familiar. The familiar grants different bonuses to Araci depending on the animal.

A large ruined palace lies far off in the world. As araci explores the world and collects treasures, they will be added to the palace and stay between games. An important event should take place in the palace near the end of the game. It should be an optional event after the main story events are finished. Should be an opportinuty to test the strength of a game-finishing build.

## Basic Ideas
* Focus on synergies between weapons, skills and the environment
* Avoid randoms. Crit chance, dice rolls, roguelike "choose between 3" systems, etc.
* Progression should be about choosing a path to complete the story with the desired build
* Quests should not exist in a vaccuum. Each quest should alter the game with a unique reward, altering the map, changing the story, etc.
* Avoid Metroidvania type area unlocking. No special items should be needed to access paths or areas that aren't available early on.
* No roguelike permanent passive progression between runs (game should not get easier the more you play except by skill).
* Every weapon should be distinct and have its own playstyle and feeling
* Each weapon has a skill tree
* Magic skills augment weapon attacks and give unique abilities and passive bonuses
* Skills are themed early on for specific class/archetype but at higher levels there are many synergy skills meant to blur between, with requirements for multiple trees to unlock
* Synergies are intuitive: Wind + Lightning = Storm, Wind + Snow = Blizzard, etc.
* Each skill has a noticeable impact on the game -- No +5% 
* Shrines can be prayed to in order to make a PACT
* A pact is meant to significantly change your playstyle by giving a large boost but disabling or penalizing somethign else heavily: glass cannon, pacifist, no magic, etc.

### Possible Ideas
* Offerings can be processed into finer offerings that offer better, more powerful skill trees or pacts?
* Tools can be bought/found that allow processing offerings
* Some skill trees can only be levelled with rare offerings
* Avoid armour, resistances, etc. all enemies should take the same damage, or make concept more intuitive

## Characters
Characters each have their own starting passive bonuses.  

### Araci
His village was destroyed by demons. He is on a quest to close the portals and kill the last demon.
Specializes in Katanas, Bombs, and Fire.

### Assassin
On a mysterios mission to kill the sorcerers. Has gained a lot of power

## Weapons
Start with a choice of weapon. Each weapon has a different skill tree. Weapons should have a primary attack and a secondary attack or ability. Weapons have attack combos, some attacks require other conditions such as moving in a direction. Attacking with a weapon grants experience which grant skill points each level. Higher level weapon skills allow expending levels of the magic meter to do powerful techniques.

## Combat
Attacks come in combos depending on how many attacks are made. A combo can be finished with a secondary technique that changes depending on its place in a combo.

Attacks can be dodged with a sidestep which grants a brief window of invulnerability. The step can be held (double-tapped ?) to dive/roll farther.

Some weapons can parry. Parrying should be easy. Does not do damage but will block damage and could stun the attacker.

### Types
#### Spear
Defensive playstyle. Focus on thrust attacks with weaker sweep attacks. Good range.
Different Stances. In idle stance, the spear is all the way back. Breaking this stance creates a powerful thrust, or a 360 degree sweep. In thrust stance (after a thrust), more thursts can very quickly be comboed, or stance returns to idle stance after a time. A swing will bevery weak, unless moving away while swinging from thrust stance, returning to idle stance after the attack. A swign attack always returns to idle stance.
Primary: Thrust attack. Timing between thrusts changes the power. After a thrust the spear is slowly pulled back, the further back the spear is, the stronger the thrust.
Secondary: Sweep attack. The further back the spear, the wider the sweep.
Special attacks: 
* Move back which chaining sweep after a thrust. A wider 360 degree sweep while leaping backwards

#### Claymore / Katana
Medium speed and damage. Consistent attack pattern with a variety of different attacks. Versetile Low magic synergies. 
Primary: A medium spead swing in an arc. Can be chained to another swing indefinitely.
Secondary: Parry. No combo finishers.
Special Attacks:
* Parry several enemies to stun them. Stunned enemies can not block or dodge and could be easier to kill (execution ? sekiro?)

#### Clay Bomb
Ranged weapon. Can carry different types with different attacks such ass explosive, create area with fire, smoke, poison gas, etc. Tactical playstyle.
Primary/Secondary: Throw different types of equipped bombs.

#### Two Hander/Odachi
Slow but high damage. Large sweeping attacks. Hard to defend so armoured playstyle is probably needed. Attacks have many different phases, combos are different depending on phase the folowup attack is used:
* Windup Phase: as the attack starts, before the main attack, will cancel and start the new attack
* Attack Phase: during the main sweep, followup attack will be very weak
* Cooldown Phase: As the attack ends, and sweep slows. Followup attacks are most powerful, with useful techniques
* Stop Phase: No longer attacking. Next attack starts a new combo.
Primary: Wide, powerful sweep. Can be quickly chained for much weaker attacks
Secondary: Overhead attack.
Special Attacks:
* Chain primary after primary during cooldown: 360 whirlwind. Can be combined indefinitely.
* Chain Secondary after primary during cooldown:  Leap forward with powerful overhead smash.

#### Unarmed
Fast but weak. Meant for magic focused style. Fastest attack speed. Lots of magic synergies.
Primary: Punch
Secondary: Kick
Special Attacks:
* Attack while stepping: Leap attack much farther
* Attack while rolling: powerful attack at end of roll

#### Hammer
Area of effect smash attack.
Primary: Bash attack. Each combo'd bash attack can be faster than the last.
Secondary: Vertical smash.
Special attacks: 
* Followup secondary with secondary: uppercut smash knocks enemy back
* Followup secondary after many primary attacks: powerful overhead smash with an area. The more primary attacks, the more powerful the smash.

## Magic
Magic is granted by gods/spirits as rewards for offerings. Intuitively it is an external presense that becomes stronger based on the player's actions. Magic can affect the player, enemies, or the world.

Magic is a mechanic with a meter that builds up as the player attacks enemies with their weapons. It slowly goes down over time. As the meter fills, it will hit different stages. Each magic ability becomes enabled a certain stage.
There are 4 stages:
1) Ambient magic. Mostly passive environmental effects. Small combat bonuses.
2) Weak magic. Small changes to environment. Skills start affecting playstyle. Enemies can be passively affected.
3) Strong Magic. Skills can hurt enemies or alter the terrain and environment in ways that change how the map works. Skills require certain playstyle to optimize.
4) Ultimate Magic. Powerful skills that have additional requirements to trigger. Can affect huge areas and instantly kill enemies. Terrain can be drastically altered or even replaced with new areas.
Each level is more difficult to achieve than the last. Some passive bonuses can increase meter gain.
Some special actions during combat grant bonus meter:
* Parrying an attack
* Killing an enemy
* Stunning an enemy
* Applying a status effect

Magic skills can be gained by making offerings to shrines. Different offerings give access to different skill trees.
