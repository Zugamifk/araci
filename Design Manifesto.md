#### Synonyms Are Bad
Words have contextual meaning, and add to cognitive load when playing a game. Avoid words that are synonymous or near synonymous in game terms:
* There should only be one dmage over time effect and its name should be unique. Avoid fire, poison and bleed all at once or choose only one to be damage over time.
* Avoid Crits if other random chances for bonus damage exist. Choose one bonus source of damage. Chance to triple damage, Change to backstab, Chance to kill, pick only one.
* Choose one source to mitigate damage. Dodge, evasion, phasing, luck

#### Words Are Better Than Numbers
Numbers mean math. Math is not fun.
Define things in terms of intuitive conditions. Give those conditions numerical values the player can see if necessary.
* Instead of a Strength stat, have a strength status. Weak, Average, Strong.
* Instead of an increased crit chance, make a player Lucky.

#### Random Is Lazy
Random chances do not give the player agency. They encourage retrying, gambling mentality. There are better ways to add variance to a game without randomization.
* Synergies between mechanics encourage players to explore the depth of how the mechanics interact
* Practicing a game and tailoring to the best players creates a high skill ceiling for players to aim for. Create alternate paths and areas only skilled players can access.
* Most AI is inherently random on some level, but often still predictable. Create more dynamic environments that allow AI agents to use a wider range of behaviours.
* Add weapons or other usable items that are hard to use properly without a good understanding of mechanics. Encourage replaying through practice.

#### Good Dialogue Is Valuable
Dialogue should not pad out the game. It should not exist just to create breathing room for the player. When a dialogue heavy event happens, the dialogue should be informative. It should give the player information that will help them in the game. 
* Lore exposition is not important, it's a waste of time
* Characters should be interesting and relatable, but also useful. The player should care if they die or disappear, and not just for emotional or narrative reasons. Every important character should have a value in the game.
* Dialogue sequences should be as short as possible. They should give the player information they need. All other dialogue is boring.
* Environmental dialogue (NPC chatter, player acknowledgement, narrator comments) should only exist insofar as they add to atmosphere. They should not be distracting or annoying.

#### Explosions Are Only Fun When I Make Them
