### Opening 
_Araci is rowing a small boat along a river. The boat pulls up to a small dock, where Araci gets off and pulls out a catch of fish. He notices something is wrong in the villiage and drops the fish, running into the village. The village is empty, and several houses are burning. In the middle of the village, he finds several bodies including that of his uncle.

_Overcome with grief, Araci collapses to the ground over his uncle. After a moment he gets up again. 

**The player is prompted to move to a nearby shrine.**

_Araci kneels at the shrine. A vignette appears and shrinks around Araci before the screen fades to black. After a moment, words appear on the screen

Mysterious voice: Gods don't answer empty prayers, you know.

_The screen fades back in and a man is now standing over Araci, holding somehitng in his hand

Man: Take this. Burn it. 

_Araci takes the offering form the man and lays it at the foot of the shrine, then lits if on fire.

**The prayer menu appears. For this prayer, only the prayer for knowledge is available.**

Man: Ha! It seems someone is watching over you. Fortunate.

_The man pulls out his sword. After a brief pause, he tosses it to the ground in front of Araci

Man: I am done fighting for their attention. 

_He begins pulling off his armor, tossing the pieces to the ground as he does.

Man: Maybe you will have better luck than I.

I am too old and tired to fight these battles. Perhaps these tools will work the hands of the Gods. To me, they have become a burden.

There's a temple not far from here. Some kind of demon is guarding the area. 

Kill him. Surely the Gods will be watching.

_The man pauses

Man: Nothing to say? I will take your boat. A fair exchange, I think.

_The man begins to walk away, then stops

Man: The world is a cruel place. Justice is bittersweet. Don't let vengeance destroy you.

_The man leaves.

**The player is prompted to interact with the weapon and amor.**

_Araci puts on the armor and picks up the sword. He swings it clumsily a few times, accidently digging thrusting it into the ground. With a brief tug, he pull it out again._

_A burning house collapses, opening an exit path.

**At this point, the world is opened but only a single path leads ahead. As Araci walk along the path, he encounters his first monster. A Frog Demon jumps out of the water and attacks Araci. 

**When the demon is killed, it lets out a loud shriek. In the distance, dozens of other shrieks are heard in response.

_Araci encounters many more frog demons along his path until he finally reaches the temple 

_At the outskirts of the area of the temple, Araci meets an old woman

Woman: Araci! Stay away from here!
